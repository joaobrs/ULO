A self-contained linear optics simulator in a single file. 
Here the emphasis is on easy of use and readability, over raw performance.

**YOU CAN GET THIS CODE, TOGETHER WITH PRECOMPILED BINARIES, HERE:**

↝ [http://www.peteshadbolt.co.uk/public/loqc-simulator.zip](http://www.peteshadbolt.co.uk/public/loqc-simulator.zip) ↜

You will need [Python27](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy), [matplotlib](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib), and (optionally) [progressbar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2).

The `c-source` folder contains `C` code which compiles to a much faster implementation of the permanent.

# TODO:
Do not trust my implementation of the Reck scheme! Comments welcome.
