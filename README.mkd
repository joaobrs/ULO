This is stripped-down implementation of the linear-optics simulator built into [http://github.com/peteshadbolt/qy](qy). It will hopefully be easier to build, install, and maintain.

**YOU CAN GET THIS CODE, TOGETHER WITH PRECOMPILED BINARIES, HERE:
[http://www.peteshadbolt.co.uk/public/loqc-simulator.zip](http://www.peteshadbolt.co.uk/public/loqc-simulator.zip)**
**THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO START SIMULATING STUFF**

You will need:
    - [Python27](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
    - [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)
    - [matplotlib](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#matplotlib)
    - (optionally) [progressbar](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/progressbar/2.2)

Alternatively you can build it from the source provided here.
Caveats:
   - Do not trust my implementation of the Reck scheme! Comments welcome.
   - I usually define phaseshifters as a 2-mode U acting on the lower rail, and I ignore a factor of two in the phase - be careful!
