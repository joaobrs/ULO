#Î¼LO

A linear optics simulator in one file. 
Emphasis is on easy of use and readability over performance.
Still a work in progress.

You will need [Python27](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and [numpy](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#numpy)

Circuits are described by JSON files. A tool to rapidly prototype these circuits is on the way.

```json
[{"pos": {"x": -8, "y": 0}, "type": "bellpair"},
 {"pos": {"x": -8, "y": 5}, "type": "sps"},
 {"pos": {"x": -7, "y": 0}, "type": "crossing"},
 {"pos": {"x": -5, "y": 1}, "ratio": 0.5, "type": "coupler"},
 {"pos": {"x": -3, "y": 2}, "type": "crossing"},
 {"pos": {"x": -1, "y": 4}, "type": "crossing"},
 {"pos": {"x": 0, "y": 0}, "type": "bucket"},
 {"pos": {"x": 0, "y": 2}, "type": "bucket"},
 {"pos": {"x": 0, "y": 4}, "type": "bucket"}]
 ```
